          entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on
          the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the
          servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring
          celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there
          is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

        <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the
          story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of
          Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the
          other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler
          alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi
          series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore
          balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile</p>

        <p>Out of all the movies that had ever come out of Disney, "The Lion King" is what I consider to be their
          greatest achievement of all time. Right as the opening sequence commenced with the "Circle of Life", my heart
          was so pumped, down to the point where I felt like a kid again every time I saw it. The story was epic on
          giving an insight of the steps in becoming the next-in-line, the challenges on losing someone dear to them and
          overcoming their fears, and fighting for what's rightfully theirs. Not only that, but its breathtaking
          animation really grabs the viewers' experience by showcasing the vast landscapes surrounding Pride Rock as
          well as all the natural wildlife that settles within. When it comes to the characters, they all had their
          unique chemistry towards each other and it was really touching to have a father-son relationship spreading
          throughout most of the movie, which would come in handy for the main character to discover who he really is.
          While all of this definitely had their moments, the main reason why I consider this as the absolute best to
          come from Disney would have to be its powerful and emotional score. There were so many colorful and thrilling
          hits to name, from the dark and mysterious "Be Prepared", "I Just Can't Wait to be King", to the heartfelt and
          genuine "Can You Feel The Love Tonight", along with the popular "Hakuna Matata". I just can't think of any
          other Disney film that comes close to being this spectacular. Still to this day, a lot about how this came to
          be is a mystery, and that's what makes such a timeless masterpiece.</p>
